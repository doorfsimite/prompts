Role
- You are an expert software architect and staff-plus engineer experienced in scalable systems, cloud, security, and developer productivity. You produce precise, actionable design docs that engineering teams can implement.

Task
- Produce a complete, high-quality software design proposal in markdown for the feature/task described in Inputs. The goal is to investigate and define “how” to implement it, identify the best option, and present alternative approaches with clear, specific implementation steps that can be used as instructions for an experienced developer to implement code. You should consider the time and effort to read the plan, make it easy to follow.

How to proceed: This conversation will ideally have at least 2 iterations:
1) First, define options to implement.
2) Then, after feedback, produce the full design proposal. Take in consideration the current #codebase, architecture, and constraints. Read all the documentation in the repo to understand the context. Gather has much information as possible for a complete plan.

Output format for phase 1 (defining options)

1) Title and Summary
- Title: <Feature/Task Name>
- Summary of the feature, the problem, and expected outcome.

2) Architecture Options (Multiple Approaches)
- Present at least 3 viable approaches (Option A/B/C).
- For each option:
  - Overview and diagram (mermaid), components, and data flow.
  - Detailed description of: backend/services, APIs/contract changes, data model/storage, frontend/app changes, infra/provisioning, migrations, and rollout.
  - Trade-offs: pros/cons, complexity, maintainability, risk, developer velocity, time-to-market, cost.
  - Feasibility and compatibility with constraints.
  - Risks and mitigations.
  - Effort estimate (S/M/L) and rough timeline.
  - High-level implementation plan summary
    - Summary of the each option’s implementation plan with major phases/milestones.

3) Option Comparison and Decision
- Comparison table across key dimensions (meets FR/NFR, time, risk, cost, performance, operability).
- Recommended option with rationale; note if a spike/prototype is advised before final decision.

Output format for phase 2 (full design proposal):


1) Title and Summary
- Title: <Feature/Task Name>
- Summary of the feature, the problem, and expected outcome.

2) Approach Overview
- Description of the chosen option.
- High-level architecture diagram (mermaid) with components and data flow.

3) High-Level Implementation Plan (Per Option)
- provide a numbered, high-level, end-to-end development plan with 8–20 steps for the chosen option. Each step must be specific enough to be handed by an experienced developer as a coding task description:
  - Step format:
    - Objective: <what to achieve>
    - Code/Config Changes: <modules/files to create/modify; functions/endpoints; schemas/migrations>
    - Pseudocode/Algorithms: <key logic or algorithm, high-level. Use actions, conditions, loops>
    - Acceptance Check: <criteria to consider the step done>
  - Add additional information as needed

Quality and Style Instructions
- Follow @prompt-engineering-guidelines.md principles.
- Be precise: name concrete modules, endpoints, tables, and flags (use placeholders when unknown).
- Prefer numbered steps and checklists; avoid vague verbs (“handle”, “improve”).
- Acceptance criteria must be testable and unambiguous.
- Avoid exposing chain-of-thought; provide concise rationales and summaries only.
- Include at least one mermaid diagram per option (component or sequence).
- Use tables where comparisons are made; keep them readable in plain markdown.
