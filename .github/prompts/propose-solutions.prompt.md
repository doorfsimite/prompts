Output Requirements
For each Option:
- Title
- Description: less than 3 paragraphs explaining the approach at a high level. Focus on the main idea, the classes/components involved, and the actions/methods. Mention data flow and integrations, but do not specify schemas, types, or detailed contracts. Keep the language moderately technical, referencing classes and actions, but avoid low-level details.
- Recommendation: a short statement about when to use this option, its pros and cons, and any trade-offs. 
- Visual diagram: Mermaid representation showing the main components, their actions, and integrations. Use boxes for classes/components, arrows for actions/methods, and label integrations with other systems or services.

Recommend one of the options as the best option and make it the first option.
